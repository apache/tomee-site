*The TomcatEjbFactory as discussed in the [OnJava article "OpenEJB: EJB for Tomcat"|http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/02/12/ejb_tomcat.html] is no longer required.*

As of OpenEJB 3.0 references from Servlets to EJBs happen automatically with usage of the [@EJB annotation|OPENEJBx30:Injection of other EJBs Example] in the Servlet, Filter or Listener or with the <ejb-ref> or <ejb-local-ref> declared in the web.xml.

See the [Tomcat Integration|OPENEJBx30:Tomcat] page for the most up-to-date details on using OpenEJB inside Tomcat.
