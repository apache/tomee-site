Title: EJB 3.0 Sample Applications

Each EJB 3.0 sample application comes with JUnit unit tests that can be run
Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, Maven, Ant or any IDE or build system without
special plugins using OpenEJB as an embedded EJB container.  The easiest
way to run a sample application in your IDE is to use maven (*mvn eclipse:eclipse*
or *mvn idea:idea*) to generate project descriptors.
