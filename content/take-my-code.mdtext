Title: Take My Code
Gladly!  We (the individuals who makeup the community) will happily take
your code.

The easiest way for us to take code both legally and practically is by:

1. Create a patch and attach it in a [new JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENEJB)
1. Send a note to the dev list

Anyone who is a committer has already signed a [Contributor License Agreement](http://apache.org/licenses/#clas)
 (CLA) stating that the code they contribute is intended to be licensed
under the Apache Public License.  If you intend to contribute a lot,
consider sending one in as it will make things go faster.  The next best
thing to having a CLA on file.
