Title: JavaEE6 Sample

Each JavaEE6 sample comes with JUnit unit tests that can be run
in Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, Maven, Ant or any IDE or build system
without special plugins using Apache TomEE as an embedded JavaEE container.  The
easiest way to run a JavaEE sample in your IDE is to use maven
(*mvn eclipse:eclipse* or *mvn idea:idea*) to generate project descriptors.
