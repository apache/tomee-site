Title: Java EE 6 Example

Each Java EE 6 example comes with JUnit unit tests that can be run
in Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, Maven, Ant or any IDE or build system
without special plugins using Apache TomEE as an embedded JavaEE container.  The
easiest way to run a Java EE 6 example in your IDE is to use maven
(*mvn eclipse:eclipse* or *mvn idea:idea*) to generate project descriptors.
