Title: Source Code

<a name="SourceCode-Browsing"></a>
# Browsing

You can browse the source code via the [web interface](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomee/tomee/trunk/)
.

# Downloading

You can download (aka checkout) the sources of Apache TomEE with
Subversion client using the following URL [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)
.

Performing the checkout from the command line using the subversion client
is as easy as executing the following command:
> $ svn co [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)

If you are experiencing problems with errors like "400 Bad Request
(http://svn.apache.org)", try using:
> $ svn co [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)

or alternatively with Apache Maven 2 or later:

> mvn scm:checkout
> -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk
> -DcheckoutDirectory=tomee

It's not yet known how to see the progress of the checkout as mvn
scm:checkout checks out the sources non-interactively. It's worth to know
about the command, though, as it doesn't require the subversion client.

# Continuous integration

Apache TomEE continuous integration relies on [Apache Buildbot](http://ci.apache.org/).
All builders are available [from the page](http://ci.apache.org/builders).

* [Apache TomEE under Ubuntu](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-ubuntu)
* [Apache TomEE under Windows using a Sun/Oracle JDK](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-win-sunjdk)
* [Apache TomEE under Windows using an IBM JDK](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-win-ibmjdk6)

# Building

To build the code, you'll need to grab a copy of [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
 version 3.0 or later.  The standard build command is as follows:

    $ cd tomee
    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests -DfailIfNoTests=false

Alternatively, if you've made changes to the code and want to verify them, you can run with tests on:

    $ cd tomee
    $ mvn clean install

The output of that command should end with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

## Memory Settings

It's likely you run into the infamous `OutOfMemoryError` and the solution is
to increase the available memory for Apache Maven. Depending on the system
you're working on, the fix can be as easy as `_export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m`
on MacOS and Unices or `set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m` on MS Windows.

## Binary locations

Once built, the TomEE binaries will be located at:

    $ ls tomee/apache-tomee/target/*.zip
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-jaxrs-1.5.2-SNAPSHOT.zip
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-plus-1.5.2-SNAPSHOT.zip
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-webprofile-1.5.2-SNAPSHOT.zip

The OpenEJB standalone binaries will be located at:

    $ ls assembly/openejb-standalone/target/*.zip
    assembly/openejb-standalone/target/apache-openejb-4.5.2-SNAPSHOT.zip
