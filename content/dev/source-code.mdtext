Title: Source Code

You can browse the source code via the [web interface](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomee/tomee/trunk/)
.

You can download (aka checkout) the sources of Apache TomEE with
Subversion client using the following URL [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)
.

Performing the checkout from the command line using the subversion client
is as easy as executing the following command:
> $ svn co [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)

If you are experiencing problems with errors like "400 Bad Request
(http://svn.apache.org)", try using:
> $ svn co [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk)

or alternatively with Apache Maven 3.0.5 or later:

> mvn scm:checkout
> -DconnectionUrl=scm:svn:http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomee/tomee/trunk
> -DcheckoutDirectory=tomee

It's not yet known how to see the progress of the checkout as mvn
scm:checkout checks out the sources non-interactively. It's worth to know
about the command, though, as it doesn't require the subversion client.

###Continuous integration

Apache TomEE continuous integration relies on [Apache Buildbot](http://ci.apache.org/).
All builders are available [from the page](http://ci.apache.org/builders).

* [Apache TomEE under Ubuntu](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-ubuntu)
* [Apache TomEE under Windows using a Sun/Oracle JDK](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-win-sunjdk)
* [Apache TomEE under Windows using an IBM JDK](http://ci.apache.org/builders/tomee-trunk-win-ibmjdk6)

###Maven
To build the code, you'll need to grab a copy of [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org), version 3.0.5 or later.
 
###Memory Settings

It is pretty much guaranteed that you will need to give Maven an increase on the available memory.  
Depending on the OS you are working on the fix can be as easy as `_export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx768m -XX:MaxPermSize=256M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=64m -Xss2048k`
on MacOS and Unices or `set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx768m -XX:MaxPermSize=256M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=64m -Xss2048k` on MS Windows.

###Full Build

The standard build command is as follows (Skipping all tests):

    cd tomee
    mvn clean install -DskipTests -DfailIfNoTests=false

Alternatively, if you've made changes to the code and want to verify them, you can run with tests on (Takes about 2 hours):

    cd tomee
    mvn clean install

The output of that command should end with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"

It is also possible compile and test individual modules.  
Just change to the module directory and run the same commands as above.

###Quick Build

If you are in a hurry, and let's face it most of us are, you can run a quick build without the examples:

	mvn -Pquick -Dsurefire.useFile=false -DdisableXmlReport=true -DuniqueVersion=false -ff -Dassemble -DskipTests -DfailIfNoTests=false clean install

###Binary locations

Once built, the TomEE binaries will be located at:

    ls [project]/tomee/apache-tomee/target/*.zip
	
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-jaxrs-[version]-SNAPSHOT.zip
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-plus-[version]-SNAPSHOT.zip
    tomee/apache-tomee/target/apache-tomee-webprofile-[version]-SNAPSHOT.zip

The OpenEJB standalone binaries will be located at:

    ls [project]/assembly/openejb-standalone/target/*.zip
	
    assembly/openejb-standalone/target/apache-openejb-[version]-SNAPSHOT.zip
