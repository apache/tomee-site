Title: Releasing

If you've never released before, you'll need to create a GPG key to use for signing the binaries.

 - http://maven.apache.org/developers/release/pmc-gpg-keys.html

That key will need to be appended to this file:

 - http://www.apache.org/dist/openejb/KEYS


As well, you'll need to ensure you have your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file updated like so:

    <settings>
      <profiles>
        <profile>
          <id>apache-release</id>
          <properties>
            <gpg.passphrase>yourGpgPassphrase</gpg.passphrase>
          </properties>
        </profile>
      </profiles>
      <servers>
        <server>
          <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
          <username>yourApacheId</username>
          <password>yourApachePass</password>
        </server>
        <server>
          <id>apache.releases.https</id>
          <username>yourApacheId</username>
          <password>yourApachePass</password>
        </server>
      </servers>
    </settings>

Note: if you get "authorization failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge" error a workaround is to specify the user and password in the command line using -Dusername=XXX -Dpassword=YYYY. Another solution is to give them to maven release plugin but take care to not commit it!
